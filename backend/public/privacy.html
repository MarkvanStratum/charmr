    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 20 August 2025</p>
    <p class="box"><strong>Summary:</strong> Charmr is a mainstream dating app. We collect the minimum information needed to run our service, help you find matches, and keep the community safe. This Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p><strong>Controller:</strong>(“Charmr”, “we”, “us”). Contact: <a href="mailto:privacy@Charmr.app">privacy@Charmr.app</a>.</em>.</p>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This Policy applies to our websites, apps, and related services (the “Service”).</li>
      <li>Charmr is for adults only. <strong>We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 18.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account & Profile:</strong> name, username, date of birth (age), gender, preferences, photos, bio, interests, and settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Interactions:</strong> likes, matches, messages, reports, and content you share (including images you upload). Private messaging between consenting adults is permitted but must comply with our Terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Device & Usage:</strong> IP address, device identifiers, app version, log data, crash data, cookies and similar technologies.</li>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> city/region (approximate from IP) and, if you enable it, precise location to improve matching and safety features.</li>
      <li><strong>Payments:</strong> subscription purchase details (plan, amount, timestamps). Card data is processed by our payment processor; we do not store full card numbers.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety & Moderation:</strong> content flags, blocks, reports, and signals we use to detect spam or policy violations. We may use automated tools and human review.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional sensitive data:</strong> If you choose to share sexual orientation or other special‑category data, we process it only with your <em>explicit consent</em> and you can withdraw consent at any time in settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use your information (and legal bases)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Provide the Service</strong> (create your account, show profiles, enable matches, messaging) — <em>contract</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Personalise & improve</strong> (recommendations, A/B tests, analytics) — <em>legitimate interests</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety & enforcement</strong> (detect spam, abuse, illegal content) — <em>legitimate interests</em> and <em>legal obligations</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing</strong> (news, offers) where permitted — <em>consent</em> (you can opt out anytime).</li>
      <li><strong>Payments & subscriptions</strong> — <em>contract</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal compliance</strong> (tax, regulatory requests) — <em>legal obligation</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensitive data (if provided)</strong> — <em>explicit consent</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing your information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers (processors):</strong> hosting, analytics, customer support, anti‑abuse tools, and payment processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Other users:</strong> information you choose to include on your profile or share in chats (be mindful about what you share).</li>
      <li><strong>Law enforcement or regulators:</strong> where required by law or to protect rights, safety, and prevent harm.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> as part of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, subject to this Policy.</li>
      <li>We do not sell your personal data. If we engage in “sharing” for targeted advertising under applicable law, we will provide opt‑out mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be transferred to countries outside your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards such as adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses.</p>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We keep account data while your account is active.</li>
      <li>Upon deletion, we delete or anonymise data within a reasonable time, except where we must retain it for legal, fraud‑prevention, or safety reasons.</li>
      <li>Backups and logs are retained for limited periods and then purged on a rolling basis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location (e.g., UK/EU under GDPR or certain US states), you may have rights to access, correct, delete, port, restrict, or object to processing; and to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. You also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.</p>

    <h2>Cookies & similar technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and similar technologies for authentication, security, and analytics. You can manage preferences in your browser and (where required) via our cookie banner. For more detail, see our <a href="/cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a> (if applicable).</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement technical and organisational measures designed to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; use caution when sharing personal details.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>Charmr is for adults only (18+). If you believe we have information about a minor, contact us and we will take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>Third‑party links</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to third‑party sites or services. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice (e.g., by email or in‑app). Your continued use of the Service after the effective date means you accept the updates.</p>
