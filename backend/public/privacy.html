      <li>We do not sell your personal data. If we engage in “sharing” for targeted advertising under applicable law, we will provide opt-out mechanisms.</li>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be transferred to countries outside your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards such as adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses.</p>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We keep account data while your account is active.</li>
      <li>Upon deletion, we delete or anonymise data within a reasonable time, except where we must retain it for legal, fraud-prevention, or safety reasons.</li>
      <li>Backups and logs are retained for limited periods and then purged on a rolling basis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location (e.g., UK/EU under GDPR or certain US states), you may have rights to access, correct, delete, port, restrict, or object to processing; and to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. You also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.</p>

    <h2>Cookies & similar technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and similar technologies for authentication, security, and analytics. You can manage preferences in your browser and (where required) via our cookie banner. For more detail, see our <a href="/cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a> (if applicable).</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice (e.g., by email or in-app). Your continued use of the Service after the effective date means you accept the updates.</p>
