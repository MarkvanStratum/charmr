    <h2 id="eligibility">1. Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong> to use the Service. We do not permit minors.</li>
      <li>You represent that you have the authority to enter into these Terms and that your use complies with applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="account">2. Account & Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity under your account.</li>
      <li>Provide accurate, current information and keep it updated.</li>
      <li>We may require identity or age verification to help keep the community safe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="subscriptions">3. Subscriptions & Billing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Charmer offers two paid access options: <strong>£15 for 1 month access</strong> or <strong>£25 for lifetime access</strong>. The billing descriptor may reference “wmart.online”.</li>
      <li><strong>No free trials are currently offered.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>All payments are processed using 3D Secure authentication</strong> (Strong Customer Authentication) where applicable, adding an additional layer of protection against unauthorised use.</li>

      <!-- Refund Policy -->
      <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> While subscription payments are generally non-refundable once access has been granted, we always aim to resolve issues fairly and promptly. If a payment was made in error, was unintended, or the customer did not recognise the charge, please contact us at support@charmr.xyz. We use real-time alert systems (including Ethoca and Verifi) to identify unrecognised or unwanted transactions and issue refunds proactively when appropriate. Nothing in this policy affects your statutory rights under applicable law.</li>

      <li><strong>Chargebacks:</strong> If you believe a payment was made without your authorisation, please contact us first. In most cases we can resolve the issue or refund the payment immediately, which helps prevent unnecessary chargebacks. Filing a chargeback does not guarantee a refund if the transaction was valid, but we will always work with you in good faith to reach a fair solution.</li>

      <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Payments are handled by third-party processors. We do not store full card details on our servers.</li>
      <li>We may change prices or plans; changes will apply to future purchases after notice.</li>
